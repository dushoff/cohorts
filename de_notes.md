- line numbers and equation numbers would be handy
- top p.3: is your notation for the flows consistent with vandWatm?  they use script font for flows, roman font for matrices, I think; perhaps helpful to look at [my lecture (06) on this method](https://davidearn.github.io/math4mb/lectures/LectureSchedule.html)
- p.3: you mean partial rather than total derivatives (all over the place)
- "delta-thingy" is the Kronecker delta
- p.5 FIXME: I do think understanding the meaning of all terms is worthwhile
- p.6: in principle you could have linear infection terms arising from vertical transmission
- p.8: in this SIR model without vital dynamics, there is a continuum of DFEs, not just the one you mention, so this is a degenerate example; the SIR *with* vital dynamics would be helpful to discuss
- p.9: I'm a bit uncertain about what you mean in a few spots.  It might be helpful to concurrently discuss specific examples, such as the SEIR model or an Erlang SIR model.  Showing examples where you can and cannot solve explicitly for the DFEs would be helpful.
- why is $\Omega'$ not just all susceptible classes?  I guess you want to exclude $R$ compartments regardless of whether or not they have outflows.
