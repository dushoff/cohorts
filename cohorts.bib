	abstract = {A precise definition of the basic reproduction number, R0, is presented for a general compartmental disease transmission model based on a system of ordinary differential equations. It is shown that, if R0{\textless}1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R0{\textgreater}1, then it is unstable. Thus, R0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector–host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.},

	abstract = {This primer article focuses on the basic reproduction number, ℛ0, for infectious diseases, and other reproduction numbers related to ℛ0 that are useful in guiding control strategies. Beginning with a simple population model, the concept is developed for a threshold value of ℛ0 determining whether or not the disease dies out. The next generation matrix method of calculating ℛ0 in a compartmental model is described and illustrated. To address control strategies, type and target reproduction numbers are deﬁned, as well as sensitivity and elasticity indices. These theoretical ideas are then applied to models that are formulated for West Nile virus in birds (a vector-borne disease), cholera in humans (a disease with two transmission pathways), anthrax in animals (a disease that can be spread by dead carcasses and spores), and Zika in humans (spread by mosquitoes and sexual contacts). Some parameter values from literature data are used to illustrate the results. Finally, references for other ways to calculate ℛ0 are given. These are useful for more complicated models that, for example, take account of variations in environmental ﬂuctuation or stochasticity.},

	abstract = {The next generation matrix approach for calculating the basic reproduction number is summarized for discrete-time epidemic models. This approach is applied to six disease models developed for the study of two emerging wildlife diseases: hantavirus in rodents and chytridiomycosis in amphibians. Two of the models include discrete spatial patches. For each model, is calculated in terms of the model parameters. For , if a small number of infectives is introduced, then the wildlife disease dies out. Global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is verified for a special case of the SI hantavirus model when . In addition, a numerical example indicates that there is a transcritical bifurcation at , with the disease dying out if but tending to an endemic level if .},
